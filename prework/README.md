## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

- Duolingo
    - Lore: Duolingo has a cast and crew of multiple distinct characters that exist in the app and online in branding/marketing.
    - Notifications: Duolingo popularity can be attributed to that fact that you get notifications throughout the day from these characters that remind you to DO YOUR DUOLINGO.
    - UI: Duolingo's UI sparks joy. Full of color even in dark mode, it is just a fun app to look at (even if Duo is angry at you for not doing a lesson).
- Discord
    - Animations: Discord has a high degree of animations in the app and I love seeing the UI react to my interactions.
    - Customization: Discord allows for a high level of customization. You can change your name, profile image, cover image, server name, status, and more. 
    - API: Although you can't use the API as a user, you can create an near unlimited about of bots to do whatever you need for free.
    
- Letterboxd
    - Design: It is beautiful and consistent. I believe good design builds trust and leads to a deeper relationship to the user.
    - Extremely stable: I think it's a blessing to see a popular app not stuff the application with features.

    
App Idea: Competitive Letterboxd. I want the features of Letterboxd, the gamification of Duolingo, and the customization of Duolingo. I want an app to make me feel bad for not watching movies and Duolingo is great at that. Letterboxd is great for social movie watching, but I don't find movies there (usually its chatter from Twitter). With competition and newer movies weighted higher would drive a bunch of people watching the newest thing more often.

    
    
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app. (what should i add)
- Changing the default viewcontrolller to experiment with rotating text.
- XCode's git manager is not the most intuitive.
